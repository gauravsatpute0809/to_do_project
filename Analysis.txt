 🧑‍💼 Customer Requirements: To-Do CLI App

Hi team,

I’m looking for a simple yet powerful command-line To-Do application that helps me manage my daily tasks efficiently. I want it to be fast, intuitive, and usable entirely from the terminal. Here’s what I need:



 ✅ Core Features

- **Add Task**  
  I should be able to add a new task with a title, optional description, and due date.

- **List Tasks**  
  Show all tasks with status (Pending/Completed), due date, and priority.

- **Mark as Completed**  
  I want to mark tasks as done using their ID or title.

- **Delete Task**  
  Remove tasks I no longer need.

- **Edit Task**  
  Update title, description, or due date of an existing task.

- **Search/Filter Tasks**  
  I should be able to filter tasks by status, due date, or keyword.

### 📦 Data Handling

- Store tasks locally (e.g., in a JSON or SQLite file).
- Persist data between sessions.
- Handle edge cases like duplicate titles or invalid dates.

### 🧪 Bonus Features (If Time Permits)

- **Priority Levels** (Low, Medium, High)
- **Tagging** (e.g., #work, #personal)
- **Export Tasks** to a text or CSV file
- **Reminders** (basic notification or terminal alert for due tasks)

---

### 🖥️ CLI Experience

- Clear help menu (`--help`)
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Friendly error messages
- Fast performance even with hundreds of tasks
